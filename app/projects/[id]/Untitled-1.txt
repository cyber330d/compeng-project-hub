3D Insights introduces a prototype Learning Management System (LMS) that integrates interactive 3D model interaction to enhance student
comprehension of complex course content, particularly in STEM education. Traditional educational methods often struggle to effectively convey spatial
or visual concepts, leading to reduced comprehension and retention among learners. By leveraging 3D models within the LMS, students can interact
with and visualize complex concepts, improving comprehension, engagement, and retention. A prototype of the LMS was developed and the capability
to upload 3D models in various export format and interact with them are integrated into the platform. This prototype demonstrates the potential of
3D-enhanced LMS platforms to revolutionize STEM education, providing a more engaging, accessible, and effective learning experience for students.
The LMS prototype 3D Insights with integrated 3D model interaction effectively demonstrated its ability to enhance student engagement and
comprehension in STEM subjects. By addressing the challenges of passive learning and the difficulty in understanding complex concepts, the system
provided an interactive and immersive educational experience. The project successfully showed that this approach can make STEM education more
accessible and impactful. Ongoing improvements and research will continue to build on these findings to further enhance the prototype’s
educational value.


Today’s education, especially in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, students often struggle to understand complex concepts using traditional text and 2D images. These methods can make it hard for students to understand complex concepts, leading to lower comprehension and retention (Smith et al., 2020). 3D Insights aims to improve this by creating a Learning Management System (LMS) that includes interactive 3D models. This new approach allows students to interact with and explore 3D models directly in the LMS, making learning more engaging and effective (Wenzel & Moreno, 2022). By integrating these 3D models, we hope to make STEM subjects easier to understand and more exciting for students

The process for the implementation of the project is summarized below:


Some of the developed prototype Screens and results are shown in the figures below. 

3D Insights introduces an innovative approach to Learning Management Systems (LMS) byintegrating interactive 3D model technology using WebGL and Three.js. This novel method enhances traditional LMS platforms, offering a dynamic educational tool that overcomes the limitations of text-based and 2D visual methods of representing learning materials and also provides a new, more engaging dimension to learning.

The prototype has strong
commercialization potential as it addresses
a critical need in STEM education. Its
innovative use of 3D models could attract
educational and corporate institutions
seeking advanced learning solutions.
Further development could lead to
partnerships with educational technology
providers and integration into existing LMS
platforms.

Future work may involve support for AR, VR for immersive learning,
gamification to boost engagement, and AI-driven recommendations
for personalize learning. Continues Continuous Research and
collaborations with educational institutions will be vital for refining
and expanding these innovations and their implementation.
